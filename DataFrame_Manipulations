I use a simply device to keep these straight:
- (l)apply: List apply always returns a list
- (s)apply: simplify apply tries to return simplified result
- (v)apply: verify apply checks the return type conforms to user supplied example
- (m)apply: multiple apply applies FUN to multiple vectors
- (r)apply: recursive apply is essentially a flatmap
- apply : no device here, only use on matrices, never data.frames
